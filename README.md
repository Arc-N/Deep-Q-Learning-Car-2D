CarAIClass - A class that handles forward propogation, learning and predicting car moves

project.ipynb - The rest of the project is here, this includes the game, the engine and everything

src - Since the project I used as reference was too big I included a github link. I did not actually adapt any code
      from it, only the idea itself. Also I adapted some code from a different ai program, mainly just how keras model syntax

Sprites - Every car needs to look cool.

Pre-Trained - I had bad luck finding a way to save my model that would work once loaded. I took some video footage
              After training the model. You can simply run the project.ipynb code and it will eventually get to the point of the video.
              The first track does not take long, its roughly 5 minutes to train but it illustrates how the AI works. :)
